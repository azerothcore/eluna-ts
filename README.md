# Eluna TS

Eluna-TS is a system that uses [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) to compile Lua files compatible with the [Eluna Engine](https://github.com/ElunaLuaEngine/Eluna/blob/master/README.md)

This project is composed by:

* ✔️ A pre-configured workspace compatible with VSCode to compile your sources
* ✔️ The `deps/eluna-ts-definitions` which adds Eluna definition files to Typescript allowing proper type-checking and intellisense feature
* ✔️ The `deps/eluna-ts-lib` which must be included in your project to add needed methods and make it work on Eluna. It also adds some useful reusable Typescript classes and functions.

DISCLAIMER ⚠️: not all Typescript features are supported by Eluna-TS, the limitations are listed inside the documentation of the TypeScriptToLua project.

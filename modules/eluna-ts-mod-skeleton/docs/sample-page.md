# Sample Page

This is a sample page.

Change the configuration in your typedoc.json to create your own documentation pages

This page uses the [typedoc-plugin-page](https://mipatterson.github.io/typedoc-plugin-pages)

You can create links to your code inside your pages the same way you would in your TypeDoc code comments, with symbol links, by leveraging either of the below syntaxes:

## Square Brackets Symbol Links

You can use [code links](https://mipatterson.github.io/typedoc-plugin-pages/pages/Advanced%20Content/code-links.html) to link your code
